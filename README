NOTE: This is an OLD distribution of MENDEL released in 2010.

This is only a source distribution of Mendel's Accountant, which means
the code must be compiled.  This is the only release which contains
the C-version of Mendel's Accountant.  Development of the C-version was 
discontinued due to the poor performance of C as compared with Fortran for
doing numerical computations.
